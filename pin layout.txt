use only external 5V supply! leds use a lot of power. use at least 2A output for psu/power brick. do not supply via 5V pin. its better to apply 5V to usb 5V with a jumper to protect your PC by removal to disconnect from MCU (and its board) but directly connect the external supply to led 5V. add 10uF - 500uF electrolytic capacitance near mcu and additional 0.1uF ceramic for smoothing to help reduce power related glitches. (do as i say not as i do. i left my caps out, lol. i have not had any issues so far, though.)

10K resistors below are an estimate. they depend on the phototransisor's sensitivity. they must be equal, though.
